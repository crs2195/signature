As remote signatures are increasingly used, by transferring processing logic to the cloud infrastructure, this repository contains examples of 'how to' sign in the cloud, using popular digital signature APIs such as iText, SecureBlackBox and PDFBox.
These applications allow the remote signing of documents in PDF format, offering a simple user access interface (currently, these APIs perform the signing of a document, working with private keys stored in Java KeyStore).
Project implementation is based on protocols defined by the CSC (Cloud Signature Consortium) standard, which proposes standardization to establish interoperable solutions for cloud-based digital signatures.
The application integrates the hash of the document signed remotely by the remote server with CSC, by making a call to the APIs. Thus, the digital signature process is reduced to standard authentication and secure data transfer, in order to sign a document the user is only required to authenticate in the application based on the credentials, registered with the CA.
